## Welcome to POLI 171 at UCSD

THIS course explores how we can make policy recommendations using
data. The overall goal of this course is to introduce a basic
framework for policy evaluation--what we call *design-based causal
inference*--essentially, how we can use statistical methods to answer
research questions that concern the impact of some cause on certain
policy outcomes. We cover the mostly commonly used research designs,
including randomized experiments, selection on observables, and
difference-in-differences and analyze the strengths and weaknesses of
these methods using applications from the real world.

From a skill-builidng perspective, this course has three objecives:
1. Introduce an analytical framework of policy evaluation and several
related methods
2. Discuss the most basic (and some of the most important) statistical
concepts
3. Equip students with basic coding skills using *R*
